# E02a-Operators
Hey all!

In this program we explored operators and how can use them to make different computations occur. With that being said, in order to comfortably work with these operators we have to have a decent understanding of data types and that's exactly the next thing we explored in this program. Using Python's built-in 'slice' operator and 'random' module, I was able to make these changes actually occur. In order to see if the coded 'def' blocks really work, you must run main.py and examine the results of the numbers and lists below in the terminal.
